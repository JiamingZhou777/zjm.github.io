I am currently a master's student at the College of Computer Science, Nankai University, under the guidance of Professor Yong Qin since 2022. I am poised to embark on a Ph.D. journey, transitioning seamlessly from my master's program in September 2024. Prior to this, I earned my B.E. degree from Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in 2022. My research interests include automatic speech recognition and domain adaptation.
