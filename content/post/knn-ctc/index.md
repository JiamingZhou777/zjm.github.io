ðŸ‘‹ KNN-CTC: ENHANCING ASR VIA RETRIEVAL OF CTC PSEUDO LABELS


**Jiaming Zhou**; Shiwan Zhao; Yaqi Liu; Wenjia Zeng; Yong Chen; Yong Qin

## Overview

The success of retrieval-augmented language models in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks has been constrained in automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications due to challenges in constructing fine-grained audio-text datastores. This paper presents $k$NN-CTC, a novel approach that overcomes these challenges by leveraging Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) pseudo labels to establish frame-level audio-text key-value pairs, circumventing the need for precise ground truth alignments. We further introduce a \emph{``skip-blank''}  strategy, which strategically ignores CTC \emph{blank} frames, to reduce datastore size. $k$NN-CTC incorporates a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval mechanism into pre-trained CTC ASR systems, achieving significant improvements in performance. 
By incorporating a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval mechanism into pre-trained CTC ASR systems and leveraging a fine-grained, pruned datastore, $k$NN-CTC consistently achieves substantial improvements in performance under various experimental settings.
